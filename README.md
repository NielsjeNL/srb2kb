# srb2kb
Server browser for SRB2Kart

To run this, first install the required packages:
```Python
pip install apscheduler flask us
```
Then launch it:
```Python
python srb2kb.py
```

This program is based on Goulart's [SRB2Kart Web Server Browser](https://github.com/raphaelgoulart/srb2kart-web-server-browser) and Golden's [SRB2-Query](https://git.do.srb2.org/Golden/SRB2-Query/tree/update-to-2.2.1).
SRB2KB is essentially a rewrite of the PHP Web Server Browser.

## Usage
You're free to use this application to host your own server browser. Would be cool if you would let us know whether this code was of any use to you.
